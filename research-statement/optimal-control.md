## Optimal control and reinforcement learning to control soft matter

Research efforts to understand the behavior of soft matter and robots (footnote1) has been successful in the past decades. Nevertheless, the inverse problems based on forward models has not been actively sought. I am particularly interested in actively applying for the combination of numerical and experimental methods to cross validate the theoretical models and experimental observation. Most importantly, a theoretical/computational model that captures the essence of physical reality has increasingly been important especially due to artificial [physical intelligence](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/) - can an AI model with simulation data learn how to deal with real soft matter? Furthermore, solving inverse problems answers the question about how this novel soft matter/robots can be used in a broader context and setting, e.g., many of industrial applications. Therefore, efforts to make experimental and computational methods aligned is important. In this Research Statement, I will propose several important problems in soft matter physics/mechanics in the context of how to design and control their behavior.

(footnote1) I will refer to soft robots in case where soft matter designed to change its configuration over time as desired. Thus, soft matter is static and soft robot is dynamic.
